# Planned Expenses App

The Planned Expenses app helps you track and manage payments by organizing them month by month. You can easily categorize your expenses and monitor your spending patterns over time.

For purchases made on credit, the app calculates the interest rate and integrates it into your monthly payments, providing a clear picture of the total cost. This feature ensures that you’re aware of how much you’re paying, including interest, for any credit-based purchases.

With this app, staying organized and keeping track of both regular and credit-based payments becomes simple and efficient.
